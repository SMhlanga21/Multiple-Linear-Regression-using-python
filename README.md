# Multiple-Linear-Regression-using-python
I did this for a class project. The goal was to create an algorithm that predicts breast cancer diagnosis based on 30 variables including breast texture. 
This project can be run in pycharm, but for better visual presentation it is ideal to run     it in Jupyter Notebook. The only thing needed is the dataset, which has to be in the same folder       as the .ipynb file to be imported without problems.

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle. I have provided the link directly to the           dataset:
